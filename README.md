1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

No, because you can only test locally with unit tests, so there is no way of testing if the other user receives the message or not.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

Yes, because max message length is a feature for each user, and it doesn't really interact with other components on an application level.
